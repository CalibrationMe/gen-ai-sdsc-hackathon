Instructions for using scripts from Firat:   
All scripts look for a specific file that won't be on github that contain tokens for corresponding APIs. 
Please create corresponding files in your own deployment with your own tokens/keys. 

Otherwise, you can use `environment-firat.yml` to install the conda environment to get these scripts working.
